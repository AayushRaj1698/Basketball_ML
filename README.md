Basketball Shooting Simulation with Polynomial Regression
This project simulates a basketball shooting game where you can manually play the game, collect data, train a polynomial regression model, and test the trained model to automate the shooting process.

Overview
The project consists of three main components:

Manual Gameplay: Play the basketball game manually, and collect data (speed, angle, and rim position) for training.

Model Training: Use the collected data to train a polynomial regression model using scikit-learn.

Model Testing: Test the trained model in an automated basketball shooting simulation.

Files
training_game.py:

A Python script where you can manually play the basketball game.

After each game, the data (speed, angle, and rim position) is appended to data.csv.

poly_regression.ipynb:

A Jupyter Notebook for training a polynomial regression model using the data from data.csv.

The trained model is exported as a pickle file (modell.pkl).

test_model.py:

A Python script to test the trained model in an automated basketball shooting simulation.

data.csv:

A CSV file where the game data (speed, angle, and rim position) is stored.

modell.pkl:

A pickle file containing the trained polynomial regression model.

Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basketball-shooting-simulation.git
cd basketball-shooting-simulation
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, install the following libraries manually:

bash
Copy
pip install pygame numpy scikit-learn pandas
Download Assets:

Ensure the assets folder contains the following images:

ball.png

hoop.png

How to Use
Manual Gameplay
Run the training_game.py script:

bash
Copy
python training_game.py
Play the game manually by dragging and releasing the ball to shoot.

After each game, the data (speed, angle, and rim position) is appended to data.csv.

Training the Model
Open the poly_regression.ipynb notebook in Jupyter:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook poly_regression.ipynb
Run the notebook cells to:

Load the data from data.csv.

Train a polynomial regression model using scikit-learn.

Export the trained model as modell.pkl.

Testing the Model
Run the test_model.py script:

bash
Copy
python test_model.py
The script will load the trained model (modell.pkl) and simulate automated basketball shooting.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pygame: For the game interface.

numpy: For numerical operations.

scikit-learn: For training the polynomial regression model.

pandas: For handling the CSV data.

pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
